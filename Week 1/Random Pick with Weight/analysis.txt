Analysis of random pick weight:::::

input : w[1,4,3,6]  ---weight array
here, 1 represent the weight of index 0,
      4 represent the weight of index 1
      3 represent the weight of index 2 and
      6 represent the weight of index 3
total wight of indices = 1+4+3+6 = 14
problem: pick index randomly based on their weight proportions

here:
probability for each index being picked is 1/4 (1/total number of indices)
but the problem is about index being picked based on its weight proportions.
therefore,
probability of index 0 being picked should be(based on weight) = weight of index 0/ total weight of index
                                              = 1/14
probability of index 1 being picked should be(based on weight) = 4/14
probability of index 2 being picked should be(based on weight) = 3/14
probability of index 3 being picked should be(based on weight) = 6/14

when you try to pick index randomly from weight array, its probability will be always be based on total
number of index and not its weights proportion. so one thing is clear, you have create another array
which will give u the index probability based on weight

lets create a cumulative weight array for given weight array
c[1, 5, 8, 14] ----cumulative weight array

here c[0] = 1 which is the cumulative sum of w[0]
     c[1] = 5 cumulative sum of c[0] and w[1]
     c[2] =  8 cumulative sum of c[1] and w[2]
     c[3] = 14 cumulative sum of c[2] and w[3]

now, we will use this array so that index will be picked based on wight proportions

To randomly pick a number, we need random number generator
question: what should be range of random number?
ans: since we are picking indices based on weight proportions, it should be equal to our total weight(14)

# for python
random_value = random.random() * total_weight
random() gives number in the range 0-1 ,
so if we multiply it by total weight (14) we get the range 0*14 - 1*14  i.e 0-14

# visual representation of cumulative weight array
c [1,5,8,14] can be viewed as
[1  ,2,3,4,5,  6,7,8,  9,10,11,12,13,14 ]

for index 0 i.e value 1 to be picked, the random value should be between [0,1] inclusive
for index 1 i.e value 5 to be picked, the random value should be between (1,5] . 1 is not included
for index 2 i.e value 8 to be picked, the random value should be between (5,8] . 5 is not included
for index 3 i.e value 14 to be picked, the random value should be between (8,14] . 8 is not included

we can see that, the probability for index 1 being picked is 4/14. since any random number generated
in range [2,3,4,5] will result in picking 5 i.e index 1.
calculation:
The probability of each number in this range[2,3,4,5] being picked is 1/14. (since our total range is 1-14)
so total probability = probability of 2 + probability of 3 + probability of 4 + probability of 5
                     =       1/14       +      1/14        +      1/14        +     1/14
                     = 4/14

similarly, probability for index 2 being picked is 3/14.
           probability for index 3 being picked is 6/14.
           probability for index 0 being picked is 1/14.
