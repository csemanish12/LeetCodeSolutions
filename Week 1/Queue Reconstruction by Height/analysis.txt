Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

# sort queue by height

question analysis:
There are 6 list meaning 6 persons in the queue. each person is represent by [h,k].

Here [7,0] represents a person where
whose 7 represents the height of the person and 0 represents the number
of people(whose height is greater or equal to 7) that
can be in front of this person in the queue
similarly,
4,4 means , the height of the person is 4 and number of people that can be in front of this person in the
queue is 4.

so when we look at the queue,
*first person in the queue is [7,0]
-while arranging by height:- the number of people (with height greater or equal to 7) in front of him/her
 should be zero. which is true in this case.
*second person in the queue is [4,4]
-while arranging by height:- the number of people(...)in front of him should be 4 (max).
 currently, there is one person in front of him(with height > 4).the sorting in ok so far.
*third person in the queue is [7,1]
--while arranging by height:- the number of people(...)in front of him should be 1 (max).
 currently, there are two person([7,0] and [4,4]) in front of this person.
 the height of first person is 7 and second person is 4. the sorting is ok so far (as there is only one
 person with height greater or equal to 7 in front of him
*fourth person in the queue is [5,0]
-while arranging by height:- the number of people(...)in front of him should be 0 (max).
 currently, there are three persons([7,0], [4,4] and [7,1]) in front of him/her.
 the height of two person is greater or equal to 5 ([7,0], [7,1]). the queue is not sorted.
 we need to move this person([5,0]) somewhere in the queue, where only with person with height small than 5
 can stand in front of him/her

Note: h,k or  [4,4]  represents a person and condition that must be full filled while sorting the queue
      by height. here k=4 does not mean that there are 4 person in front of him or there should be 4 person.
      it means that if this person stands in a queue then there can be maximum 4 people in front of him
      whose height is greater or equal to 4. this implies that there can be several people in front of him
      whose height is less than 4


and so on for the rest.....

insight: queue should be created in such a way that k in h,k is full filled for each person.
eg: [h,k]= [7,0]. instead of viewing k as the number of people in front of this person in the queue,
visualize k as the condition that needs to be full filled whenever you put this person in the queue.
so the condition for the person to be put in the queue is that, no one with height greater or equal to 7
should be in front of him/her. only people with height smaller than 7 can be placed in front of this
person.


Solution approach:
1. sort the list by height(h) in descending. For same height,
 sort the list by number of people in front(k) in ascending
 i.e   [7,0], [7,1], [6,1], [5,0], [5,2]


Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
